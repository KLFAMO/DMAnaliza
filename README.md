This project is aimed at the analysis of optical atomic clocks data for testing cosmological theories predicting transient fine-structure constant variations in time in the form of pulses or oscillations.

# Installation

To run the project `timanda` library need to be importet. You can download the project from [https://github.com/ppmor/timanda] and install using

# Branches

- `main` - production branch (not used yet)
- `test` - developers' main branch

# Issues

When solving an issue:
- Prepare a new branch with the name: `issue-<number of issue>-your-title` (for example: `issue-154-using-fourier-analysis-for-oscillations`). The branch should be created from the `test` branch.
- Add comments/questions to the issue if needed.
- Prepare a pull request (to the `test` branch) when the code is ready. If the task is more complicated, you can split it into multiple pull requests (for example, if you have already spent 1 week on it).
